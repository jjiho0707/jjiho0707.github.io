NOTICE : I'm currently improving my english skill so this post sounds a bit unclear and not fluent.
plz forgive me :(

when I was a high school student(about 2years ago), I was trying to solve this problem:

###problem
when multiplying N*M matrix and M*K matrix, the number of operation to complete multiplying is N*M*K.
and when multiplying N of matrices, the whole number of operation differs to the order of multiplication.
(by associative property of matrix multiplying)
then, given N of matrices' size what is the minimal number of operation?

I wanted to solve this because it gives so much rating in solve.ac...
so I read the hu & shing's paper and anyway implemneted it with cpp.
but I didn't understand whole logic or intuition with that. so, I'm gonna understand logic and the intuition of this paper.
(with my upgraded brain during 2 years...)

###first idea
TODO : complete this post
